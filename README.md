# equiwaste
**Problem statement in ECO HACK'21 (IEEE SSIT)**
Metropolitan cities face a common issue of waste management and
find it difficult to maintain a proper system of waste segregation
and processing. Municipalities and Treatment plants currently face
challenges in keeping a track of wastes being picked up by workers
along with the disposal system incorporated by various resident
societies and industries. Put forth a solution that gives a coherent
system to simplify the process thereby providing transparency as
well as placing an efficient system into place. <br />  <br />

Our solution to this is Equiwaste, a website that helps in disposing waste better by its various efficient features like connecting users and waste truck companies,
navigation for truck drivers, smart bins and helping users locate bins nearby etc.
